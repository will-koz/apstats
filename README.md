# AP Statistics

AP Statistics is a test offered by College Board for people proficient in statistics. Several
functions covered in the course can be expressed in Haskell code, so as I go through the course over
the following year, I plan to write the relevant functions to gain a better understanding of the
content.

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out how quartiles and other ntiles should be implemented
